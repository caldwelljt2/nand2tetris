This file is required, but contents don't matter.

This is my own implementation in Javascript of an assembler for the hack machine code. It currently outputs two files, the assembly and a symbols file. the symbols file is ONLY for troubleshooting issues and is simply named based on the name given for output (

Usage: node assembler.js FILENAME.asm FILENAME.hack

Output:
FILENAME.hack - Binary executable code for hack
FILENAME.hacksymbols - compiled symbols file used during the assembler's operation.
